## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- **Learning API Requests with nba_api:** Making reliable and structured calls to fetch live player data took several attempts and debugging steps.

- **Building a Web App (First Time):** Streamlit was new to me, and setting up a clean, responsive layout took trial and error.

- **Deployment Debugging:** Pushing to Streamlit Cloud caused issues due to missing packages and folder structure — I learned to separate app logic from environment setup.
